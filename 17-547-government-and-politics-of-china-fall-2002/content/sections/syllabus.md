Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Objectives and Organization
---------------------------

This course is designed for undergraduates and graduate students as a comprehensive introduction to the politics of the People's Republic of China. The course takes as its organizing theme China's ongoing quest for modernity, a quest that has its roots in the 19th century and continues to shape Chinese politics today. The turbulent and often tragic history of the PRC can be viewed as a succession of efforts to answer a basic dilemma: how can China stand up, erase the shame of fallen empire, and recover the glory of a once-great civilization? The course is divided into four parts, each corresponding to a particular historical era and that era's answer to the challenge of modernization. How did the political system evolve to accommodate frequently changing, and often radically divergent, definitions of national strength and modernity? Moreover, how should we understand the relationship between citizen and state in this context? What is the role of the citizen in a system structured to maximize national self-realization, and how has that role changed over time? How should we go about understanding the concept of governmental legitimacy in China?

The basic objective of this course is to provide students the means to come to their own conclusions regarding China's political system. The ultimate hope is that by critically evaluating China's system, we will be forced to reflect more deeply on the nature of our own.
